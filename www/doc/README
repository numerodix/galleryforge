++ What's the point of galleryforge?
I have taken quite a few pictures over the years. I also like to pick some of
them to publish on my website. For every time I publish them, I create an
"album" of images, which is little more than just keeping them organized and
being to identify when they were published and what title they go under. I
would then keep each album in a separate directory, simply because that's
practical. I used a different program to create these albums in the past, but
with the number of albums growing, I got tired of it and decided to roll my
own solution, scratching an itch in the conventional hacker way. The
assumption is that I have multiple directories, I would even like to
categorize and sub categorize them, each directory is an album and each
album has any number of images. Every album has a number of album pages, each
of which displays a number of thumbnails of images, and clicking on a
thumbnail opens a page with the image in full size.


++ How does it work?
galleryforge takes the supplied directory and scans all sub directories for
image files. Where an image is found, the image is resized to the maximum
allowed size and a thumbnail is created. For each of these directories
galleryforge creates album pages (displaying thumbnails) and image pages
(displaying full sized images).


++ How to use it?
Simply run 'galleryforge' and supply a path to your gallery. In the gallery,
create directories for every album and place images inside them. Running
galleryforge will process your images and create the html pages. Re-running
galleryforge on directories where it has already run is safe, meaning existing
images will not be overwritten (all html WILL be recreated, because it's not a
large performance overhead, so that changes in templates are reflected in the
new html).


++ Which file formats are supported?
galleryforge generates jpeg, gif and png images from jpeg, gif and png images 
respectively. Formats supported for input are bmp, eps, pcd, pcx, ppm, tga,
tiff, xpm.


++ Quirks?
It was not intended to keep images in directories which have both images and
sub directories, so organize your directories so that each directory contains
either only images or only directories. It was also not intended to keep
images in the basedir of your gallery (because directory names are
interpreted as album titles) the one directory containing all the other 
directories (which in fact follows from the first rule). If you ignore this
rule, galleryforge will not behave expected.


++ How to run from the command line?
On linux, simply run
$ galleryforge <basedir_of_your_images>

On Windows, run (make sure the path to python.exe is correct)
c:\> c:\python\python.exe c:\galleryforge\bin\galleryforge 
<basedir_of_your_images>


++ How to run the gui?
On linux, simply run
$ galleryforge-gui

On Windows, double click the "galleryforge-gui.py" icon on your desktop
or run (make sure the path to python.exe is correct)
c:\> c:\python\python.exe c:\galleryforge\bin\galleryforge-gui


++ How can I customize the look of the HTML pages?
galleryforge is made to be very customizable. The directory 'templates'
contains the templates for all the pages generated. You can modify these
files to your heart's content, just remember to keep the replacement tags,
such as ${album} intact, otherwise galleryforge will complain.
